# open-source-artware-workshop
In this workshop you will learn the in[put]s &amp;&amp; out[put]s of creating an open source project. Participants will design/propose speculative artware (software art) projects (no code, just ideas) around which we’ll learn to construct the proper open source infrastructure. Learn the history, theory &amp;&amp; practice of open source culture: What is open source? Where’d it come from? What are its benefits? What are the rules? What are some established conventions for collaboration?How does one choose a license? What’s “git” and how do I make a “repo”? Where do I put it? How do I maintain an open source project?
